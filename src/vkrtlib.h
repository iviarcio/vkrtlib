// NAME
//   vkrtlib.h
// VERSION
//    0.1
// SYNOPSIS
//    Vulkan runtime library -- vkrtlib -- is a GPGPU engine based on Vulkan.
//    It eats SPIR-V compute shaders and executes them without any graphical
//    context, much like OpenCL. The interface is very abstract and allows you
//    to get to work with your shaders as quickly as possible. With the current
//    state of compute shaders, you should be able to achieve ~OpenCL 1.2
//    feature parity.
